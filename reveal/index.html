	<h2>How Does this relate Back to Media Archeology? </h2>

	<aside class="notes">
		In This section I will relate back to Zombie Media and expand further as I did not get much of a chance to expand on the idea of a piece of media may be over looked in society and will eventually die off. But this form of media isn't dead but waiting for its resurrection into society. This resurrection isn't a direct remaking but a more complete better version similar to the one previously know to be present in the past and this is called Circuit Bending mentioned by Garnet Hertz and Jussi Parikka in Zombie Media: Circuit Bending Media Archaeology into an Art Method

<h2>Viewing Media Archaeology From a Bending Circuitry Perspective </h2> 
 
 
 
 
<aside class="notes"> 
 
 
 
If its not broke donâ€™t fix is a perfect quote to begin with, so why fix and change something when you can modernize it. Walter in this example was limited to scarce technological advance in coding and electronics but what he was successful in was changing the functionality of wearables. HIs installation was essentially bent and adjusted into what we see today this based idea of a screen encapsulating you creating a new environment was bent made more portable and more functional allowing the concept and idea to stay true but the circuitry behind the mask to be changed which is a perfect example of Bending Circuitry.
