![](reveal/img/walter01.jpg)

<P> This Pecha Kucha tackled the work of Walter Pichler focusing on his Prototyping Escape where he displayed his TV Helmet/Portable Living Room and Small Room in 1967. What these two projects focused on was expressing what he believed to be the future of modern life in the future. His work was a early staged virtual reality set presenting the capability of creating a alternate reality within a wearable. After researching Walter it was understood he was potentially the first person to create the concept of virtual reality and brought it to life in his installations. His work was a parody emphasizing how people became reliant on technology and displayed how humans strive to achieve making tasks easier, having everything within reach. His tow 1967 installations depicted what we see today as virtual reality and after breaking it down to its most basic form function, they were essentially identical other than the advance gyroscopic motion sensors displayed in modern virtual reality. is goal very similarly to virtual reality today was to take a user to a unique location escaping from their current location encapsuling them into a new universe, the technological universe. This is essentially the ancestor of Virtual reality an influence what we have available to us. Looking back in history this art installation originally used as a parody to display humanistic wants and needs had a major influence on what we see today in society. This does not only incorporate our need for escaping reality by using virtual reality, but also our reliance on technology itself. These Cahnges can be seen in  <P>
