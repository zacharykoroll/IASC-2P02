 <p align="center">
My names Zachary Koroll I'm a fourth year IASC student graduating in the fall of 2018.  I plan on focusing on GIS and the analysis of mapping information, using my knowledge in the field to analyze crimes and predict future crime based on the information at hand. My existing projects in IASC 2P02 may not show display my skill level for my future endeavors but my work in IASC 2P07 displaying my capability of using high end mapping programs like ARC GIS to be used later in my career as a Police investigator. These programs take a high skill level to learn and using them properly  will help advance me in my  career in policing. My overall goal is to become a geographical analyzer for the police force or even the Canadian army. Being able to use programs like these will put me a step in the right direction in creating geographical patterns associated with crime, violence and even terrorism, allowing me to speed up the time it takes to solve a crime and prevent them in the future. I believe this to be a major role in modern day investigating and preventative tactics used by the police force and army and I believe in the near future I will be an asset graduating from an IASC major having previous experience with these programs.
